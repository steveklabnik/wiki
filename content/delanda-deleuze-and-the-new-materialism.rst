These are my notes on Manuel de Landa's "Deleuze and the New
Materialism" lecture on the EGS YouTube account. He gave this lecture in
2009. I'll be putting hr's between the parts.

"If you're gonna be betting your carrer on something, bet it on the
thing that has the most potential to be developed. I'm putting my money
on Gilles Deleuze."

A materialist is someone who believes there is a world that exists
independently of our minds. This is the most important thing.

we affect the world and the world affects us

many processes are too slow for us to have a direct experience of them

they are beyond phenomenology

If something is separate from our minds, how do you explain its
identity? Classically, there is an 'essence' (eg, mountainhood,
birdhood, sheephood)

Nobody believes in essentialism anymore, so how can we get beyond this?
the answer is the process that produces it.

--------------

He takes things from science and re-uses them in a 'properly
philosophical' way

Today we're going to trust scientists

We get rid of essences by adding processes of production

Kant vs. Hume

The only Hume-ian in continental theory is Deleuze

--------------

assemblages/totalities to explain the body.

totality: if you remove the heart, a person dies! Obviously, a person is
whole

asemblage: you can remove a heart! science! just replace it with a
pacemaker, put the heart on ice, it still works, it's all good.

it's very easy to think in totalities: The State, The Market

Instead of discussing concrete totalities, they talk about abstract
things

"capitalism" and "globalization" are too essentialist to be useful

--------------

scientists are not shining the light of rationality onto the world.
they're human. science is social.

two types of science: royal science vs. workers/minor science

deleuze allows us to take the objective content without worrying about
the public relations aspects of science

Spinoza: big difference between thinking of God as a personal entity
(biblical God) and a different thing to think of God as an impersonal
entity (plane of immanence)

transcendent space (heaven/hell) still exists if all matter disappears

immanent space needs matter/energy to exist (Spinoza's God)

--------------

Deleuze had to recover Spinoza's richness

"my favorite way would be to bring a gun with me, put the gun to your
leg and say "do you believe in the material world" and if you said 'no'
I'd shoot you."

three reasoning styles borrowed from science

1. population thinking
2. intensive thinking
3. topological thinking

--------------

a rainforest is so complex you need all three reasoning styles to
understand it

what guarantees the mind-independent identity of the world?

essences survived into the 20th century because Aristotle was a badass

you can't just dismiss Aristotle

the discovery of dna gave us a material basis for you to pass your
characteristics along

population thinking:

any population of variable replicators coupled to any filter...

--------------

... or sorting device, gives you evolution.

Replicator: DNA as means of re-creating something

variability: there needs to be differences between members of the
population

evolution is fueled by differences. without difference, there's nothing
to filter

in animals the largest source of variability is sexual reproduction,
mother + father = child

evolution cannot occur with Adam and Eve

extinction (nucleation threshold) is caused by a minimum size
population, you don't need to kill every last animal

--------------

the environment acts as a filter/sorting device

other animals too

breeding animals, pick smaller/less hair dog, get chihuahua

generic/specific comes from aristotle, part of everyday language

this shows you how difficult it is to get rid of essences

for aristotle, sameness is most important
