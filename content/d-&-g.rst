One thing about the collaboration between `Deleuze </deleuze>`_ and
`Guattari </guattari>`_ is that there are really three entities here:
Deleuze, Guattari, and D&G. The introduction to A Thousand Plateaus:
Capitalism and Schizophrenia, D&G acknowledge this:

    The two of us wrote Anti-Oedipus together. Since each of us was
    several, there was already quite a crowd. Here we have made use of
    everything came within range, what was closest as well as farthest
    away. We assigned clever pseudonyms to prevent recognition. Why have
    we kept own names? Out of habit, purely out of habit. To make
    ourselves unrecognizable in turn. To render imperceptible, not
    ourselves, but what makes us act, feel, and think. Also because it's
    nice to talk like everybody else, to say the sun rises, when
    everybody knows it's only a manner of speaking. To reach, not the
    point where one no longer says I, but the point where it is no
    longer of any importance whether one says I. We are no longer
    ourselves. Each will know his own. We have been aided, inspired,
    multiplied.
