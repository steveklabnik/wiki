Full disclosure: I helped contribute early reviews of much of the
content of this book.

Sandi does a really great job, but not for the reason you'd expect:
POODR is more pragmatic than one would expect. Especially in the Rails
world, where OO design is looked down upon as 'academic' and 'not
actually worthwhile,' one would expect all the usual explanations and
reasonings.

But not this book. Sandi does a great job of explaining the tensions
between all of these different maxims, and acknowledges that software is
always in flux; in many ways, it's more of a process than a product.
Some techniques are useful at different points in that process, and
sometimes, business constraints don't allow for constructing perfect
software, if such a thing were even possible.

I'm still slightly concerned with the primary metaphor for much of the
design: a bicycle. Too many people think of objects as only being
concrete 'things' that you can touch or feel, and while the bicycle
metaphor works well, I'm hoping that it doesn't further encourage this
style of thinking. This is, again, a Rails concern, and POODR doesn't
really concern itself with Rails. But in Rails apps, there's a real
problem with monolithic models, and while POODR *should* help, I'm not
sure it goes far enough in that regard.

But seriously, that's the only complaint that I have about it, it is a
truly excellent book.
