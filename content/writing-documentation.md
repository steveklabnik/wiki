Writing Documentation
=====================

Documentation Difficulties
--------------------------

Writing documentation is really hard.

It's also hard to get people to contribute to documentation. I had a
conversation with someone recently that was frustrated about the Rails
documentation: "Here's my blog post about how to do X. Apparently that's
what Rails people do rather than write docs." When I asked why they
didn't contribute to the docs rather than make Yet Another Blog Post
that feeds into the exact problem they were talking about, it just
hadn't actually occurred to them. Getting started contributing to a new
project is difficult, posting something to your blog is easy.

Most people don't find writing docs to be fun, and Open Source is
largely driven around doing what's fun.

It's hard to see the flaws in something you're close to. The people who
are closest to a project forget how hard it is to come in from nothing;
I had a conversation recently about Hackety Hack where someone was upset
it didn't have the ability to make folders and multi-file projects, and
when I tried to explain to them that the beginners (children and adults)
that I teach actually struggle with things like file management, they
were shocked. We all forget just how much we know, because it's easy to
us!

Furthermore, there's an incentive for people to write blog posts over
contribute to official docs, since then people will link to their blog,
with all the benefit that comes along with.
