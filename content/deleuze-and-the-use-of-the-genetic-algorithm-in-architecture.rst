I have yet to read anything by Manuel Delanda, but a few of his books
are on my wish list. However, I recently watched this lecture by him
twice in a row, and it is damn good. `Here it is on
iTunes <itmss://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/manuel-delanda-deleuze-use/id412480536?i=90057056>`_.
It's about applying genetic algorithms to art and architecture, but
specifically through `Deleuze </deleuze>`_'s materailism.

Here's my outline of notes:

Notes
-----

Main point: to introduce Deleuze's materalism and explain its usage for
architects with genetic algorithms

Materailism
^^^^^^^^^^^

the world exists separate from your mind

no phenomonology

not dialecticalism

idealism is inherently conservative

postmodernism went idealistic because materalism leads to essentailism
because of questions of identity

the novelty of deleuze's materailism is that it needs to essences

theory of form

matter is inert, form is imposed upon it

deleuze inverts this, matter is morphogenetic

artist's relation to materials is now changed; partnership rather than
creationism

soap film computes surfaces, and is form finding

shapes designed procedurally

computers specify processes

process of production

elements of design modelled as a process

programs are genes

genjam is accepted as human in jazz clubs

CAD is all isntructions

impose your will on software through scripting

genes don't specify final result

evolution relies on the morphogenetic properties of matter

--------------

Deleuze uses three reasoning styles

population thinking - evolutionary biology

intensive thinking - thermodynamics

topological thinking - math

synthesis overrides silly academic boundaries, this is the role of the
philosopher

popluation thinking
-------------------

evolution needs a large breeding population

not enough space for variation in adam & eve

there is no 'ideal zebra'

homogeneity stops evolution, because it gives evolution nothing to
filter

terrible cliches, 'survival of the fittest'

there are many ecological strategies

no such thing as the fittest

species are trapped in a local maxima

evolution as a search process

evolution sees species

only sees you as you reproduce

blind groping of a search space

intensive thinking
------------------

extensive vs. intensive properites

extensive: length, volume

intensive: pressure, speed, density

extensive properties can be divided in space

intensive properties cannot

"difference"

intensive differences drive processes

extensive vs. intensive maps

intensive maps: high pressure zones, cold fronts

differences in intensity give birth to forms

'different' is not negative

embroygenesis

evolution relies on intensive differences

critical points where matter changes form

ice -> water -> vapor

horse gaits, walk -> trot -> gallop

topological thinking
--------------------

as opposed to Euclidean

Gauss and Riemann

differental geometry

transcendental space is needed to metricise euclidean space

differential calculus

black box diffeq

rate of change -> box -> intstantaneous value

non-euclidean surface becuase a surface of rapdity and slowness; ie,
difference

einstein uses this to talk about curvature of space

1919 eclipse gathered experimental evidence that confirmed his
hypothesis

topological thinking lets use think of spaces of possibilities when
modelling systems

attractors are features of topological spaces that represent tendancies

genetic algorithms are search algorithms that explore spaces of
possibilities

ex: phylum

tree of life

"abstract body maps"

we can use toplogical spaces to represent phylums

artists can use topological spaces to find designs, and use genetic
algorithms to help them navigate those spaces

Deleuze's new materialism is very different and should revitalize the
left
