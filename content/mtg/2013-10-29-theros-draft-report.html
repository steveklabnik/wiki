<h1 id="theros-draft-report-2013-10-29">Theros Draft Report: 2013-10-29</h1>
<p>I recently played my first DCI-sanctioned Magic: the Gathering event since… at least 2008. This is half draft report, half nostalgia, be warned. :)</p>
<h2 id="the-draft">The Draft</h2>
<p>I showed up a bit early, eagar to play. I had no idea what the crowd down at my local gaming store was like, and I had some vague unease about being the old dude. Like, I played Magic in high school, but now I’m almost 30. I have… interesting memories of the older people that I used to play with long ago. Turns out the crowd was within five years of me all around. Also all men. Out of twenty players, four were Asian and one was black, and a bit older than the rest of us. That’s actually a <em>bit</em> more diverse than in my years past…</p>
<p>I <em>also</em> wondered how my politics would come into play here. I decided that for this first time, I was just going to observe, not say anything, but I wondered how much terrible shit people were going to say. Frankly, when I played, I said lots of terrible shit. So when I say, “there was only one rape joke, one ‘retarded,’ and one ‘gay,’ so that was good,” hopefully you’ll know what I mean. Overall, it was great. Everyone was really polite, with the aforementioned few exceptions. I was pretty open about being way out of date, and nobody made fun of me for being new, or not knowing what cards were, or taking some time to make decisions.</p>
<p>One last bit on people: the guy who was working at the time reminded me <em>so much</em> of the dude who worked at my local gaming store back in the day. Looks, personality, mannerisms, it was weird. I wonder if there’s some correlation there, or of it’s just some sort of weird freak accident. He was also exceedingly nice to me, even before I spent some money. He gave me a quick rundown of which rules changed since the last time I played, and reassured me that he was a certified judge, so if I had any questions during the tournament, I should come to him and ask. Awesome.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, my local Magic crew seems pretty welcoming and friendly. Not perfect, but better than I was expecting. Does that say something about me, or just the crew I surround myself with nowadays?</p>
<p>So, to the draft itself. If you’re not a Magic player, here’s the idea: Everyone buys five packs of cards. You keep three, and two go into a pool for the winners. This means that there were twenty packs of cards to split for a prize. You take the three packs of cards, choose one, and then pass the pack to the left. You then take the pack the person on the right just passed you, choose a card, and pass it to the left. You do this until the pack is empty. Then you open the next pack, and do the same, but passing to your right this time. The last pack goes back to the left. At the end, you take the cards you’ve chosen, all forty five of them, and choose about 23 to make a deck out of. You can add any basic land cards you’d like, and most people choose 17, making for a deck of forty cards.</p>
<p>This format is fun because it’s about who’s better at the game, not about who has spent more money on cards. Ironically, it’s more expensive in the long run, as you have to buy new cards every time, but since the initial cost is lower… Drafting costs $15, and in high school, I used to draft twice a week, every week… but pay $20 for four copies of a rare card I needed? Obscene! Anyway, the economics of Magic are for another time.</p>
<p>So, it had been a long time, so while I read up a bit, I basically didn’t know anything about what to do. I decided I’d just see what was good, grab every rare I saw, and go from there. No expectations. Of course, I wanted to win, but this wasn’t exactly about winning.</p>
<p>For the first pack, I opened up a really mediocre blue rare, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373542">Curse of the Swine</a>. This card is pretty meh, but it’s rare, so I took it. Next came an even worse blue rare, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373701">Swan Song</a>. Ugh. Was I just going to play trash blue? I tried to take blue, but I took any cards I thought were good. Like I said, no clue, might as well just try it. Especially for the first pack.</p>
<p>The second pack, I opened <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373661">Abhorrent Overlord</a>. Whoah. It seemed like one of those cards that’s mediocre in Constructed, but amazing in Limited. So I decided to go black this pack. That went much better. I also saw a bunch of white cards that were good, and I got a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373685">Triad of Fates</a> like fourth pick. I felt like White/Black was the best combination, but I might have to dip into my blue too. Three colors seems do-able with this particular set of cards.</p>
<p>Third pack, I opened a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373624">Sylvan Caryatid</a>. Nice! This card is too much like a previously valuable card, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221896">Birds of Paradise</a>, for it not to be worth money. So I took it, even though I had no plans for Green. Next pick was <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373671">Anthousa, Setessan Hero</a>. Apparently the player to my right wasn’t playing green! I took it, but said to myself, “three colors is okay, four colors is bad!” Third was an <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373742">Artisan of Forms</a>, and while it seems really bad for my deck, it might see use in Constructed. Maybe. So I took it. I ended up with seven rares. Yeah, most of them may be trash, but I’m just getting started!</p>
<p>Here’s the card pool I was working with:</p>

<p>Basically, “take all the black and white cards and put them into a pile. Luckily, I had drafted just enough of them. But there were two things: I <em>really</em> needed to hit four lands. So I decided that I wanted to run 18 lands, so I needed to cut two cards. I ended up choosing the Ordeal of Erebos and the Triad of Fates to leave out. In the end, I think that this was a mistake. While it’s true that the Triad isn’t that great, he’s average with weird abilities, so at worst he’s average. The Decorated Griffin should have gone instead. An expensive flyer with a mediocre ability would have been worse. Furthermore, after the tournament, someone mentioned to me the great interaction between the Triad and the Overlord: I can make the Overlord leave play, then come back, making more and more tokens. That possibility alone should have made him make the cut.</p>
<p>Secondly, I chose to cut the Ordeal of Erebos. I mis-read the card: I didn’t realize the tokens stayed around afterwards. An opponent showed me that this was a mistake in round three, and I paid the price. But more about that later. I probably should have cut the Anvilwrought Raptor in favor of the Ordeal.</p>
<p>With the deck made, it was time for the actual tournament to begin!</p>
<p>A quick note on tournament format, for those of you who aren’t familiar: Drafts are run in what’s called a ‘swiss’ format: Everyone plays a match, best of three games. This is called a ‘round.’ After each round, games are reported, and the computer matches you up against others with the same record: winners play winners, losers play losers. We had twenty people, so after one round, ten would be undefeated, after two, five, after three, two, and then after four, one person would be left undefeated. They get most of the prize, and then everyone who only lost one game and some people who lost two get prizes as well. Ties are broken by the exact record of games, so if I won 2-0, and you won 2-1, and we tied, I’d win the tiebreaker.</p>
<p>But computers handle all these details. The point is you can only lose one match if you want to win. If you lose two, it’s been fun, but you don’t get any prizes.</p>
<h2 id="round-1">Round 1</h2>
<p>Round one, I got seated at the first table! Off to a good start before it begins! I was playing against “A,” who was the person who actually worked at the shop. Fun! He again re-assured me that I should ask if I had any questions, and we got to it. He had some awesome Nyan Cat sleeves. I didn’t take extremely detailed notes, so some of the details may be a bit fuzzy here, but the situations are pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>A was playing blue/green, and it was clear he knew what he was doing. This is good; it’s actually a bit easier to play against good people, because they make rational decisions. Of course, you have to be good to beat them, but you can trust that you can at least attempt to read signals from them.</p>
<p>Game one, I came out of the gate pretty quickly, dropping some creatures and doing a fast five damage, but A stabilized pretty quickly, playing a few flying creatures that I couldn’t really deal with. He was at 17 life, and I was at 22. The only way I could strike back was with the Scholar of Athreos, using its ability twice each turn to cause A to lose two life and me gain two. I had to come up with something fast, and I did: I drew the Overlord. Whew! I was at six life, and he was at 12. I played the Overlord, and, after waiting a turn to think about it, he attacked. I blocked a few monsters, but had to let some through. I hoped he didn’t have some sort of spell to boost his power, and he didn’t: I took four, dropping down to two life. “At the end of your turn, activate the Scholar three times. On my turn, swing with the Overlord for six. Activate Scholar three more times.” Twelve damage, that’s game!</p>
<p>Game two, A drew a <em>ton</em> of bounce spells, and that absolutely wrecked me. Even the Overlord was too little too late: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373517">the sea god had his revenge</a> on the Overlord’s tokens, so he had to eat himself on my next turn. Ouch.</p>
<p>The third game went very similar to the first: I got some damage, held him off, and then flew over his head with an Overlord and company. I won with 17 life.</p>
<p>I was feeling really, really good. I won my first game, and my first match. I felt that I had played pretty cleanly, and I hadn’t made any obvious mistakes. My deck didn’t have too much land, or too little, and it seemed to curve out nicely. I wasn’t totally incompetent!</p>
<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>
<p>Round two was against “C,” who was playing black and green. I don’t remember a lot out of this match, except that the first game was really close: I was at five, then two, then won the game. They were at 9, then 7, then dead. I’m pretty sure it was the Overlord. I just kept drawing him!</p>
<p>Game two was long, but I pulled out a win. My sole note for this match says <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373670">INSATIABLE HARPY!!!</a>. C’s life total was 8, then 9, then 11, then 10, then 11, then 8, then 10, then 11, then 12, rhen 9, then 11, then 12, then 18, then 7, then dead. He had one other creature with lifelink as well, and it was silly. I had the game wrapped up, but they held on way longer than they should have by virtue of the life gain.</p>
<p>This proved to be true in the next match as well: lifelink seems to be really, really good in Limited. It lead to my first true mistake…</p>
<h2 id="round-3">Round 3</h2>
<p>Round three was against “R,” and they, to put it bluntly, demolished me. After playing so well and winning my first two matches, this one was super hard. R’s red and black deck was very well put together, and they played well.</p>
<p>Game one was all about this <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373593">Deathbellow Raider</a>. But before that, I had to mulligan for the first time: all expensive cards and no lands. Bummer. I kept my set of six, but wasn’t feeling great about it. They played a turn two Raider, and I had a blocker, but who was a 2/2, and then I had <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373648">Divine Verdict</a>, but only three mana, so when I got my fourth land, they had the mana available to regenerate the Raider. Ugh. They then put the Ordeal of Erebos on it, the very card I cut! This turned the Raider into a big huge monster who promptly reduced my life total to zero. And took two more cards out of my hand. Even in aggressive matches, card advantage is brutal.</p>
<p>I promptly sideboarded the Ordeal in, taking out the Decorated Griffin.</p>
<p>Game two, I made my first real, true, absolute flat-out mistake. I was at 13 life, and he was at 13 life. They had a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373710">Kragma Warcaller</a>, and it was really messing up my day. Together with another Raider, they’d be annoying enough, but he also had a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373709">Whip of Erebos</a> in play. This meant even though I was making some progress on his life total, R just kept gaining life. Finally, he swung with everything. I gave it some thought, and I realized that if I just took the damage, I’d go from 13 to four, but as long as I drew a creature card, I could outright win with my Erebos’ Emissary. So I took it.</p>
<p>That’s when I remembered his creatures had lifelink. By “remember,” I mean, “heard him say ‘I gain nine.’” Damn.</p>
<p>So round three was 0-2. Oh well. If I just won this last round, I still had a shot at prizes!</p>
<h2 id="round-4">Round 4</h2>
<p>Round four was against “N,” who had sat to my right in the draft. “So you’re… black and white, right?” Damn, N, you’re good! We chatted about reading signals and what cards we saw, I had reluctantly passed him a real cool looking foil common because there was an uncommon that was better for me, ha!</p>
<p>Game one, N came out of the gate really slowly. He was playing blue/green, and I got him down to ten, but then he dropped a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373635">Prophet of Kruphix</a>. He admitted it was first pick, first pack, and that’s why he went U/G. Basically, this was when I realized that my deck had one severe weakness: I couldn’t kill random creatures that didn’t attack me. All my removal was combat tricks. Even though we both mulliganed in the second game, he also got the Prophet, and being able to drop two times the number of creatures a turn as I could just doesn’t make for a very interesting story. Two games, two losses. Oh well.</p>
<h2 id="card-evaluations">Card Evaluations</h2>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373631">Asphodel Wanderer</a>: This card was totally fine. His regenerative abilities were useful once, and otherwise, he’s a 1/1 for B.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373541">Tormented Hero</a>: Never did me any good, but wasn’t able to chump block once because he came into play tapped.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373508">Returned Phalanx</a>: This wall was totally fine, even without having the blue to activate his ability. Can’t complain.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373528">Fleshmad Steed</a>: The Steed was awesome. The drawback never really bit me, and a bear was good for my mana curve.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373600">Leonin Snarecaster</a>: The Snarecaster was pretty good. His ability basically let me sneak in an early attack or two: I’d play a monster, they’d play one back, I’d drop Snarecaster and attack.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373577">Decorated Griffin</a>: Super mediocre. Wouldn’t run again.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373515">Setessan Battle Preist</a>: Very meh. I didn’t have very many good Heroic triggers, or I might have felt differently. But an aggressive deck doesn’t need a 1/3 for 1W.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373638">Blood-Toll Harpy</a>: the Harpy was fine. not great, but not bad. Always happy to cast it.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373725">Read the Bones</a>: this card was pretty good overall, but it sucks to draw when you’re behind and life is precious.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373599">Lagonna-Band Elder</a>: Pretty… okay. Remember that the Emissaries are enchantments, but not worth the loss of a toughness.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373739">Ray of Dissolution</a>: This card is <em>awesome</em>. There are tons of creatures who are enchantments now, and there are a lot of enchantments in Theros.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373692">Scholar of Athreos</a>: This card breaks stalemates wide open, and gives you something to do with your extra mana late game. Every time I could use the Scholar effectively, I won the game. That’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373745">Erebos’s Emissary</a>: This card was so good. I casted it as an enchantment a few times, and it’s great. It’s also just fine as a regular old <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129591">Hill Giant</a> with an extra ability.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373729">Heliod’s Emissary</a>: Also a great Emissary. I didn’t ever cast him as an enchantment, six mana is much easier to get than seven. His ability is great though.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373648">Divine Verdict</a>: Verdict is amazing, but remember that it won’t work against utility creatures. You still need other removal too.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373677">Anvilwrought Raptor</a>: Just bad. Too expensive, too small.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373573">Silent Artisan</a>: I got made fun of for playing this guy, but I felt he was just fine in limited. The body is big enough that the lack of an ability isn’t great. I wouldn’t always run him, but I was always happy to see him.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373697">Sentry of the Underworld</a>: The sentry was good, especially as a deterrent. I didn’t really get to use it very effectively because it scared opponents, they bounced or spot removal’d it quickly.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373661">Abhorrent Overlord</a>:</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I missed out on prizes, but I had so much fun. Magic really engages several parts of my brain that I really enjoy. It’s competitive, makes you think critically, you have to do probability and addition in your head fast, there’s a human element that you have to read. And now that I’m an adult, the financial aspect shouldn’t be as much of a burden, either. It was probably one of the most efficient entertainment things I’ve done recently, dollar per hour wise. I wasn’t going out to bars when I was in high school, either…</p>
<p>Hopefully I’ll have more reports for you in the future!</p>
