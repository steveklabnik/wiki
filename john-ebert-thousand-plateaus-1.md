This section covers chapter 1 of[Thousand
Plateaus](/thousand-plateaus), "Introduction: Rhizome"

## Notes

Plateau - an intensity that's infinite

Rhizome - way where multiplicities connect together on a non-stratified plane
of consistency

the book does not develop an argument

it's a work of anti-philosophy

-------

rhizome comes from roots under the soil

* a-centered
* anti-hierarchical
* no perhiphary
* an assemblage of multiplicities

opposes an arborescent model, which is hierarchical and has a strong spine

rhizome has no oversignifying regime of signs that subjects other regimes

6 principles of rhizomes
------------------------

### connection

anything connects to anything else

assemblage - means whereby in culture things connect together

2 types

* machinic assemblage - material flow
* collective of annunciation - language

example: man-woman in chivalry

Deleuze is different from Foucault because Foucault talks about power and
Deleuze talks about desire

plane of consistency -- of multiplicities

rhizomatic relam of multiplicities

consistent because multiplicities fill dimensions, even when extended
dimensionally

immanent as opposed to transcendant

multiple points of entry

### heterogeneity

orchid and wasp rhizome

deterritorialization / reterritorialization

orchid deterritorializes the wasp by making it a part of the orchid's reproductive apparatus

wasp reterrritorializes the orchid by mating with the image

becoming-wasp of orchid

becoming-orchid of wasp

french vs. german philsophy

french is rhizomatic

german is arborescent

### multiplicity

discussed already

### asignifying rupture

if you damage arborescent structures they collapse

if you damage rhizomatic structures, they reform a new line of flight

a line of flight is a line of segmentality that breaks off from adjoining
rupture

deterritorialization is when a multiplicity is recoded in a different context

hand is a deterritorialized hoof

z-boys deterritorialized the surfboard and reterritorialized the skateboard
in order to avoid capture by the overcoding regime of society

### cartography vs. decalcomania

tracing is transferred to an object

a rhizome makes a map

tracing is finished and imposed to an object

a tracing is put on a map, a map is not put on a tracing

-----------------

great metaphors for the left

multiplicities become hardt and negri's multitudes

--------------------

plane of consistency has no subject
