# Welcome

Welcome to [Steve Klabnik](http://steveklabnik.com)'s personal wiki. I'm your
host, Steve. Here, I plan on collecting random notes about the books that I'm
reading, things that I'm learning, stuff like that. Part research notes, part
book reviews, part Quantified Self-style knowledge archival.

Oh, and I use affiliate links here when linking to Amazon. This doesn't hurt
you, but it does help me buy more books. If a source is available legally
online for free I try to link it as well. If I've missed something, [email
me](mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com) and let me know.
