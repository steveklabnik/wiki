# Welcome

Welcome to [Steve Klabnik](http://steveklabnik.com)'s personal wiki. I'm your host, Steve. Here, I plan on collecting random notes about the books that I'm reading, things that I'm learning, stuff like that. Part research notes, part book reviews, part Quantified Self-style knowledge archival.

Right now, I don't have anything here yet. I hope to change that soon.

## Starting Points

This isn't a comprehensive set of articles, just starting places.
