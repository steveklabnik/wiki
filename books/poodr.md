Full disclosure: I helped contribute early reviews of much of the content of this book.

Sandi does a really great job, but not for the reason you'd expect: POODR is more pragmatic than one would expect. Especially in the Rails world, where OO design is looked down upon as 'academic' and 'not actually worthwhile,' one would expect all the usual explanations and reasonings.

But not this book. Sandi does a great job of explaining the tensions between all of these different maxims, and acknowledges that software is always in flux; in many ways, it's more of a process than a product. Some techniques are useful at different points in that process, and sometimes, business constraints don't allow for constructing perfect software, if such a thing were even possible.

I'm still slightly concerned with the primary metaphor for much of the design: a bicycle. Too many people think of objects as only being concrete 'things' that you can touch or feel, and while the bicycle metaphor works well, I'm hoping that it doesn't further encourage this style of thinking. This is, again, a Rails concern, and POODR doesn't really concern itself with Rails. But in Rails apps, there's a real problem with monolithic models, and while POODR _should_ help, I'm not sure it goes far enough in that regard.

But seriously, that's the only complaint that I have about it, it is a truly excellent book.
