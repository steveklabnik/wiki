 The Rhizome
=============

Overview
========

The rhizome is one of two forms of organization. It's easier to start with its
antithesis, the 'arborescent' form.

Something that's 'arborescent' has an ordering, a hierarchy, a defined
structure. The word comes from a tree, and that's the primary image: all of the
branches start from the trunk and spread outward. They also use a book example:
a book's binding is like the trunk of a tree, and the pages are branches.

A rhizomatic structure is different: it's a twisty, non-linear, network, rather
than a unified structure. It may have many beginnings and endings, twisty
little passages.

A Thousand Plateaus is arborescent in the sense that it's a book, but
rhizomatic in the sense that you should read it 'like playing a record.'
