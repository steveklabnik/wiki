Welcome
=======

Welcome to `Steve Klabnik <http://steveklabnik.com>`_'s personal wiki.
I'm your host, Steve. Here, I plan on collecting random notes about the
books that I'm reading, things that I'm learning, stuff like that. Part
research notes, part book reviews, part Quantified Self-style knowledge
archival.

Oh, and I use affiliate links here when linking to Amazon. This doesn't
hurt you, but it does help me buy more books. If a source is available
legally online for free I try to link it as well. If I've missed
something, `email me <mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com>`_ and let me know.
