Historical materialism is one of the foundational aspects of Marxism, so it
seems like a good thing to have a full grasp on.

That whole paragraph is a pretty good summary, so I'll quote it in its
entirety as well:

> In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into
> definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of
> production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material
> forces of production. The totality of these relations of production
> constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which
> arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite
> forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life
> conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It
> is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their
> social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of
> development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict
> with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same
> thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of
> which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the
> productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era
> of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or
> later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure. 

Seems good. Here's the wikipedia summary of the big moving parts:

1. The basis of human society is how humans work on nature to produce the means
   of subsistence.
2. There is a division of labour into social classes (relations of production)
   based on property ownership where some people live from the labour of others.
3. The system of class division is dependent on the mode of production.
4. The mode of production is based on the level of the productive forces.
5. Society moves from stage to stage when the dominant class is displaced by a
   new emerging class, by overthrowing the "political shell" that enforces the
   old relations of production no longer corresponding to the new productive
   forces.  This takes place in the superstructure of society, the political
   arena in the form of revolution, whereby the underclass "liberates" the
   productive forces with new relations of production, and social relations,
   corresponding to it.
