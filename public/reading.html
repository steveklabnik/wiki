                <p>One of the things that I really appreciate about reading continental philosophy
is that it's changed the way that I read. In school I had to read House of
Leaves, and what's crazy about it is that it actually invokes this weird
performative effect. In many ways, it's a book about reading. If you're not
familiar with the book, it has three separate stories embedded within each
other, a crazy amount of citations and footnotes, sometimes to fictional works.
It slowly degenerates and descends into madness in form as well as story. I
really liked it a lot, and it's on my 're-read' list soon.</p>

<p>So, anyway, when reading, say, a math textbook, you start at the beginning. You
learn what's in Chapter 1, exercise 1. Then exercise 2. By the end of the book,
congrats, you know Calculus. It's all very straightforward and laid out
straight.</p>

<p>But when tackling continental works, especially as a newbie, you really need
to just kinda dive in, accept that you're not really going to understand wtf is
going on, and just go with the flow. <em>Feel</em> the writing. Get confused.
<em>Experience</em> the text, don't just try to extract the direct meanings. There's
direct meaning too, of course, but it's about images, allegories, performance,
and affect, not just a 'straightforward' meaning.</p>

<p>What's amusing here is that this is normally interpreted as being 'vague' or
'wankery,' but it's actually often about being absolutely exact. It's not
enough to just say some words that communicate the idea, but it's an attempt
to increase the bandwidth of communication and get across the <em>exact</em> idea,
context and all. Consider a piece of music. I could give you tablature, sheet
music, or a recording. They all communicate music in some way. But the
recording also includes a performative aspect as well as 'just the music.' You
get a very specific understanding of that piece.</p>

<p>There's also a connection with linguistic relativity here, where the language
of analytic philosophy constrains your abilities to think about the problem,
because the language must be a certain way. The obsession for 'clarity' can
lead to even the absurdity of turning sentences into mathematical notation,
which isn't exactly simple either. It may be <em>exact</em> in a certain sense, but
it can also be obscuring. I find some sort of perverse joy in people taking</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The present King of France is bald.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And turning it into</p>

<ol><li>F = "the king of France"</li>
<li>G = "is bald"</li>
<li>(∃x)[Fx &amp; (∀y)(Fy ⊃ x=y) &amp; Gy]</li>
</ol><p>And saying that it is clearer. Obviously, to someone steeped in the analytic
tradition, it very may well be! But suggesting this is universal is incredibly
arrogant.</p>

<p>Deleuze also has a fantastic way of looking at this issue, in "Letter From a
Harsh Critic":</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are, you see, two ways of reading a book: you either see it as a box
with something inside and start looking for what it signifies, and then if
you're even more perverse or depraved you set off after signifiers. And you
treat the next book like a box contained in the first or containing it. And
you annotate and interpret and question, and write a book about the book, and
so on and on. Or there's the other way: you see the book as a little
non-signifying machine, and the only question is "does it work, and how does
it work?" How does it work for you? If it doesn't work, if nothing comes
through, you try another book. This second way of reading's intensive:
something comes through or doesn't. There's nothing to explain, nothing to
understand, nothing to interpret. It's like plugging in an electric circuit.
I know people who've read nothing who immediately saw what bodies without
organs were, given their own "habits,'" their own way of being one. This
second way of reading's quite different from the first, because it relates a
book directly to what's Outside. A book is a little cod in much more
complicated external machinery. Writing is one flow among others, with no
special place in relation to the others, that comes into relations of
current, countercurrent, and eddy with other flows-- flows of shit, sperm,
words, action, eroticism, money, politics, and so on.</p>

<p>This intensive way of reading, in contact with what's outside the book, as a
flow meeting other flows, one machine among others, as a series of
experiments for each reader in the midst of events that have nothing to do
with books, as tearing the book into pieces, getting it to interact with
other things, absolutely anything... is reading with love. That's exactly how
you read the book. And the bit I like in your letter, the bit I think is
rather wonderful, in fact, is where you say how you read the book, what you
yourself did with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, unless you've already read Deleuze, I bet that you didn't even know a
few of these terms, or maybe slightly confused with how they're used. 'body
without organs,' 'intensive,' 'flows,' 'machines.' How did you deal with this
when reading the few paragraphs above?</p>
