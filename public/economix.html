              <div class="content wikistyle gollum markdown">
                <p>A few friends recommended Economix to me, so I picked it up the other day. I
was expecting not to like it, but I needed to mix some light reading into
my schedule, and blew through Economix in a few hours. I really enjoyed it
overall, but like any book, it's not without it's problems.</p>

<h3>Marx<a class="anchor" id="Marx" href="#Marx"></a></h3>

<p>The first thing that I do when I read any layman's book about economics is to
check the index for the words "Karl Marx." It's sort of a filter; if they
don't strawman Marx, then it's probably pretty good. If they do, then they
probably suck. Note that I said 'strawman,' disagreement is fine, I myself
disagree with Marx on many things. But it's a pretty good way to see if someone
knows what they're talking about. So I'll start there.</p>

<p>Good 'ol Karl is mentioned just a few times in this book, and it's actually
pretty decent. It starts off with a description of the <em>Manifesto</em>, class
struggle, and some other bits of Marxist theory. However, we run into the first
weird little thing on the bottom of page 55:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the workers didn't unite, and most of the 1848 revolutions failed. Marx
fled to England with a mission: "I'll prove the revolution is coming! See if
I don't!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's my current understanding that Marx didn't write <em>Capital</em> to prove
anything about the revolution; he wrote it to gain a scientific understanding
of capitalism and how it functions. However, after thinking about it, I'm not
actually sure I know enough bibliographical information about Marx to truly say
this. My gut also says bullshit on sentences like this because of the
rhetorical function that they play in the story, which is to equivocate
Marxists and Austrians, which is just flat-out wrong. More on that later.</p>

<p>The next time we pick up with Marx, he's finished <em>Capital</em>, so Goodwin
explains its basic tenets. He does a pretty admirable job, but a few caveats
apply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marx kept Ricardo's labor theory of value, but did ask: "If everything sells
for its labor cost, where does <strong>profit</strong> come from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is hand-wavy, but hand-wavy in an important way: Marx did <em>not</em> keep
Ricardo's labor theory of value. The subtitlte of <em>Capital</em> is 'Kritik der
politischen Ã–konomie', or 'a critique of political economy.' Goodwin does a
good job of mentioning that Marx was trying to critique classical political
economy (which contains Ricardo), but then mis-handles that as well. We'll get
to that, but Marx's labor theory of value contains significant and important
differences from Adam Smith and Ricardo's theories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but profit comes from squeezing workers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not really true. Marx made it very clear that exchange is based in
equivalence, nobody is 'cheating' the laws of exchange. Surplus value (which
Goodwin mentions appropriately) is formed from the differences between
labor-power and other commodities: labor-power is the only commodity which can
create value. This isn't the page on Capital, and this book is supposed to be
an overview, but it's still a significant distortion of Marx's theories.</p>

<p>Other than this, his description of <em>Capital</em> is pretty good, and frankly, way
better than I expected when I bought this book.</p>

<p>Okay, next up, 'Neoclassical economics':</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But soon after <em>Capital</em> came out, economists started moving away from
Ricardo's labor theory of value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for good reasons! Ricardo's theory of value wasn't developed enough, for
sure. But Marx, as I mentioned above, was also moving away from it. Ricardo's
irrelevance does not make Marx irrelevant. This is why the comment above about
the differences between their labor theories matters. The book has an image
here of Marx chasing after Marshall, Walras, and Jevons, but in reality, they
should all be walking away from Ricardo. This lack of understanding is also
played out in the further description of Ricardo; also, lol at taking the
Malthusian growth model seriously at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a few other things to say, but yes. In general, I think
Economix's handling of Marx is better than I expected, and I also don't think
it's fair to expect rigour in a book like this. But these kinds of things are
why, at the end, the author suggests that you go read things on your own, and
read things for yourself. Broad overviews are just that.</p>

<h3>Conflation of Neoliberals and Marxists<a class="anchor" id="Conflation-of-Neoliberals-and-Marxists" href="#Conflation-of-Neoliberals-and-Marxists"></a></h3>

<p>On page 241, he has a panel that says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heck, it could be hard to say which was which.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This kind of thing really rubs me the wrong way, because they're basically
opposite, not equivalent. Yes, both use anti-state rhetoric, but anarchists
and communists care primarily about the health of the working class, and will
support 'growing the state' through social programs and taxation until the
collapse of capitalism. Austrians and neoliberals simply care about
non-interference by government, and have no concern for anyone but themselves.
See: Objectivisim. Even if their policies hurt people, they don't care, due
to the rhetoric around bootstraps, job creators, and lazy welfare recipients.</p>

<h3>Mischaracterization of the anti-globalization movement<a class="anchor" id="Mischaracterization-of-the-anti-globalization-movement" href="#Mischaracterization-of-the-anti-globalization-movement"></a></h3>

<p>Page 245:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We're not against globalization, we're against the <strong>way</strong> that it's
happening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vast majority of those involved in the anti-globalization movement were
ardent anti-capitalists, and were straight-up against globalization. Maybe
there were a few liberals mixed in there that said things like this, but
invoking the black bloc and implying that they are ultimately cool with
globalization is really wrong.</p>

<h3>What I liked<a class="anchor" id="What-I-liked" href="#What-I-liked"></a></h3>

<p>Other than that, I really, really enjoyed this book. It presents an overall
scepticism that I really enjoyed, a focus on pragmatics over theories, and
gives an overview of economics that is in line with most of my understanding of
the field and its various players. Details are a bit out of line, but the big
pieces are all great. It was easy to read, fun to read, and has a pretty great 
list of books in the back to follow-up on.</p>

<p>I will certainly give a recommendation of this book to anyone who wants to get
their feet wet in the wide world of economics.</p>
